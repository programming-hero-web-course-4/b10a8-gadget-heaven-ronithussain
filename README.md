## React Fundamental Concepts Used
1. **Components**: Reusable UI components for Navbar, Footer, Cards, etc.
2. **Props**: Data passing between parent and child components.
3. **State Management**: Managing state for cart, wishlist, and categories.
4. **React Hooks**:
   - `useState` for managing dynamic states like cart and wishlist items.
   - `useEffect` for fetching and updating data.
   - `useContext` for sharing cart and wishlist data globally.
   - `useNavigate` for programmatic navigation.
5. **Routing**: Using `react-router-dom` for multiple pages and nested routes.
